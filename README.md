Project 2 Description:

Refer	to	Exercise	2.1.	A	slight	variation	on	generating	the	Sierpinski	gasket	with	
triangular	polygons	yields	the	fractal	mountains	used	in	computer-generated	animations.	After	
you	find	the	midpoint	of each	side	of the	triangle,	perturb	this	location	before	sub-division.	
Generate	these	triangles	without	fill.	Later,	you	can	do	this	exercise	in	three	dimensions	and	
add	shading.	After	a	few	subdivisions,	you	should	have	generated	sufficient	detail	that	your	
triangles	look	like	a	mountain.
